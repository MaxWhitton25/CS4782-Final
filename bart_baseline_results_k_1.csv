How do histone methyltransferases cause histone modification?,"Histone methyltransferases (HMTs) are responsible for the site-specific addition of covalent modifications on the histone tails, which serve as markers for the recruitment of chromatin organization complexes. There are two major types of HMTs: histone-lysine N-Methyltransferases and histone-arginine N-methyltransferases. The former methylate specific lysine (K) residues such as 4, 9, 27, 36, and 79 on histone H3 and residue 20 on histone H4. The latter methylate arginine (R) residues such as 2, 8, 17, and 26 on histone H3 and residue 3 on histone H4. Depending on what residue is modified and the degree of methylation (mono-, di- and tri-methylation), lysine methylation of histones is linked to either transcriptionally active or silent chromatin.","Histone methyltransferases (HMTs) are involved for the modification-specific modification of histdcently hist to hist histone methyl of which are as a of the formation of newatin-.. are several H H of HMTs: Hone methylmine methyl-methylethyltransferases ( histone-methylyl- N-Mtransferases.

Is DNA methylation correlated with nucleosome occupancy?,"DNA methylation can determine nucleosome positioning. Using a novel bioinformatics pipeline, we show a striking anti-correlation between nucleosome occupancy and DNA methylation at CTCF regions that is not present at promoters. DNA methylation determines nucleosome occupancy in the 5'-CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes. In contrast, exons demonstrate a high degree of methylation and nucleosome occupancy. Although global DNA demethylation has been observed after treatment, it is unclear to what extent demethylation induces changes in nucleosome occupancy, a key determinant of gene expression. In order to systematically evaluate potential diversities among CGIs and ultimately to illuminate the link between diversity of CGIs and their epigenetic variation, we analyzed the nucleotide-resolution DNA methylation maps  of multiple cellular origins. Using this global approach, we observe the dependency of nucleosome occupancy upon the DNA methylation status. Exonic DNA methylation seems to function together with exonic nucleosomes and H3K36me3 for the proper splicing of transcripts with different expression levels. Transcription, histone modifications, and DNA methylation alter this ""ground state"" by having distinct effects on both nucleosome positioning and occupancy.

Describe the bartender algorithm,"Barcode sequencing (bar-seq) is a high-throughput, and cost effective method to assay large numbers of cell lineages or genotypes in complex cell pools. Because of its advantages, applications for bar-seq are quickly growing-from using neutral random barcodes to study the evolution of microbes or cancer, to using pseudo-barcodes, such as shRNAs or sgRNAs to simultaneously screen large numbers of cell perturbations. Bartender is an accurate clustering algorithm to detect barcodes and their abundances from raw next-generation sequencing data. It comprises a set of simple-to-use command line tools that can be performed on a laptop at comparable run times to existing methods.

What is the mechanism of microRNA deregulation in carcinogenesis?,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous non-protein coding single-stranded RNAs (19–25 nucleotides in length) generated from  cleavage of larger non-coding RNAs by the ribonuclease III enzyme Dicer. They become part of the RNA-induced silencing complex and negatively regulate gene expression by binding to homologous 3'-UTR region of target protein-coding mRNAs as an imperfect match, causing translational repression or degradation. Approximately one-third of the protein-coding genes are susceptible to miRNA regulation. Accumulating evidence indicates that deregulated miRNA expression is associated with the onset and progression of a number of human cancers. Therefore, cancer-associated miRNAs (CA-miRNAs) could regulate target genes by acting either as ""oncogenes"" or ""tumor suppressor miRNA (TS-miRNAs)"". In line with this, numerous cancers (e.g. breast, lung, oesophageal, prostate, pancreatic, gastric and colon cancer) have been classified based on their unique miRNA expression profile.","MicroRNAAs aremicroRNAs) are involved transcription-c- RN nuclestranded RNAAs thatRN-24)osides) the) that by the microavage of the non-proteinoding RNAs ( the miosuclelease- ( (-1 are involved of the DNA-binding DNAencing of of are regulate the expression. regulating to theologous RNA-strR- of the RN (1oding RNRNAs ( well essential regulator for which theocation damage of degradation of 50-third of all mi-coding RN are involved to carcinRNA deregulation,umulating mi suggests that mireg miRN- is associated with the regulation of progression of carcin carcin of carcin carcin., the cellsrelated miRNAs aremi)cRNAs) are be the protein, regulating as as am-ogenices"" or asonolerors""ors""RN""iMmiRNAs) in addition with this, the mi haveincluding.g., cancer cancer breast, lungphthalophageal, and, andic, andric, breast)) are been identified as on their expression roleRNA-..",0.3721787829359392,0.2743682310469314

Which proteins act as factors that promote transcription-coupled repair in bacteria?,"Transcription coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER or TCR) is a cellular process by which UV-induced damage and other road-blocks encountered in the transcribed strand are restored. Bacterial transcription-coupled repair is initiated when RNA polymerase stalled at a DNA lesion is removed by Mfd (Mutation frequency decline), an ATP-dependent DNA translocase. Mfd is the major transcription repair coupling factor in bacteria. Also, the transcription elongation factor NusA, in addition to its role in recruiting translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases to gaps encountered during transcription,  promotes an alternative class of TCR involved in the identification and removal of a class of lesion, such as the N(2)-f-dG lesion.","Thecription- repairotide repairision ( (transRC) T-) is a key process that which transcription-induced transcription is degradation transcriptionblocksblocks are in bacteria pathribed bacteria of eliminated.acterial transcription-coupled nucle is a by the polymerase II by the transcription-ion site removed from aethyl1Mfd-)) which importantasedependent transcription repairocationator thatfd is a most transcription- factor factor in bacteria., T transcription-ation factor,d1 is which particular to the role in the transcriptioncriptionome,,TCR) and,ase, the in in transcription repair is is transcription increased transcription of transcriptionCRs in transcription repair of repair of transcription transcription of transcriptionion- which as the TusN)dependentibf--ion,",0.41623329339384524,0.26291079812206575

How does Ssu72 mediate gene looping?,"Investigation of chromosome folding in mutants confirms roles for RSC, ""gene looping"" factor Ssu72, Mediator, H3K56 acetyltransferase Rtt109, and the N-terminal tail of H4 in folding of the yeast genome. The essential N terminus of the Pta1 scaffold protein is required for snoRNA transcription termination and Ssu72 function but is dispensable for pre-mRNA 3'-end processing. TFIIB crosslinks to both the promoter and terminator regions of the PMA1 and BLM10 genes, and its association with the terminator, but not the promoter, is adversely affected by E62K and by depletion of the Ssu72 component of the CPF 3' end processing complex, and is independent of TBP. We propose a model for RNAP II transcription in which promoter and terminator regions are juxtaposed, and that the resulting gene loops facilitate transcription reinitiation by the same molecule of RNAP II in a manner dependent upon Ssu72-mediated CTD dephosphorylation. The first 300 amino acids of Pta1 are sufficient for interactions with Ssu72, which is needed for pre-mRNA cleavage.

What is the idea behind the fractal globule that has been proposed as a model of chromatin conformation in the nucleus of a cell?,"The fractal globule is a compact polymer state that emerges during polymer condensation as a result of topological constraints which prevent one region of the chain from passing across another one. This long-lived intermediate state was introduced in 1988 (Grosberg et al. 1988) and has not been observed in experiments or simulations until recently (Lieberman-Aiden et al. 2009). Recent characterization of human chromatin using a novel chromosome conformational capture technique brought the fractal globule into the spotlight as a structural model of human chromosome on the scale of up to 10 Mb (Lieberman-Aiden et al. 2009). The fractal globule, a knot-free, polymer conformation that enables maximally dense packing while preserving the ability to easily fold and unfold any genomic locus is distinct from the more commonly used globular equilibrium model and emphasizes topological constraints as a primary factor driving formation of chromosomal territories.","The fractal globule is a model,ase that is from theizationensation and a model of theological changes. are the from from the chrom from being through the.. is-range structure region is found in the andthenven's al. 1990) and is been been fully in other. in. now.Hber etLld et al. 1989). studies of the chromatin has the fract fract-ational model method has about conceptal globule to the light. a model model of chrom chrom con chromosome basis of the to 10..1berman etAiden et al. 2009). fractal globule is which highly-like structure circularizedformation- is theally efficient chrom of preserving the structure to store transport the fold the sequence regionsus, a from the nucleus complex used modelule glob model. is theological features. well model model in chrom. chromomal regions.",0.3915486693190377,0.30107526881720426

Elaborate on the association between Genomic Regulatory Blocks (GRBs) and target genes,"Genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs) are chromosomal regions spanned by highly conserved non-coding elements (HCNEs), most of which serve as regulatory inputs of one target gene in the region. The target genes are most often transcription factors involved in embryonic development and differentiation. GRBs often contain extensive gene deserts, as well as additional 'bystander' genes intertwined with HCNEs but whose expression and function are unrelated to those of the target gene. GRB target genes have properties that set them apart from their bystanders as well as other genes in the genome: longer CpG islands, a higher number and wider spacing of alternative transcription start sites, and a distinct composition of transcription factor binding sites in their core/proximal promoters. Target gene expression correlates with the acetylation state of HCNEs in the region.","Genomic Regulatory blocks (GRBs) are aomal blocks thatanned by a conserved genes-coding RN (ncss) which notably which are as target blocks for target or gene. the genome of G gene are located commonly expressedally, in the development, are.Bs are have a genomic-, which well as a regulatoryc-er' genes. with theNEs. are expression is expression are not. the of the target gene.Bs are genes are been that are them apart from other target, well as from target. the genome. they-NEN-, longer higher C of a range of the targets factors sites, and a higher set of the factors promoters sites. the respective regionsinterteimal regions. genes binding is with the expressionylation of of theNEs, the genome of",0.5021334231866826,0.373015873015873

Yellow fever virus is a flavivirus, and there is only one antigenic type. It was taken to the Americas by the early slave traders, and nowadays reported in Africa, America, Asia and Europe. Yellow fever virus is transmitted by two different cycles: 
-from human to human by the mosquito Aedes aegypti; which is well-adapted to breeding around human habitations; the infection can be maintained in this way as ‘urban’ yellow fever.
-from infected monkeys to humans by mosquitoes such as Haemagogus. This is ‘jungle’ yellow fever and is seen in Africa and South America.

Which are the major transcription factors regulating glycolysis in mammals?,"The main positive transcriptional regulator of Glycolysis in mammals is HIF1-alpha (Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1a). HIF1-alpha is upregulated by the oncogenes c-Myc and Src, which therefore also positively regulate glycolysis. Several reports have linked HIF-1α induction with STAT3 activation. SIRT6 appears to function as a corepressor of the transcription factor Hif1alpha. NF-κB also stimulates glycolysis through the inhibition of PDK4 expression. Loss of the widely expressed transcription factor Oct1 induces a coordinated metabolic shift: mitochondrial activity and amino acid oxidation are increased, while glucose metabolism is reduced. HNF4alpha is critical for regulating glucose transport and glycolysis and in doing so is crucial for maintaining glucose homeostasis.","The major transcription transcription factors factors of glycolysis is mammals is the31.H.H2ia-usible))))IF1aalpha is aregulated in the Hcogeneetic ofationterminc and H-1 which are regulate regulate regulate glycolysis. transcription of identified HIF1alphaa to to the1- and Hrc1 is to be as a transcription transcription of of H glyal HIF1a.-κB is regulates glycolysis in the activation of H-1 and. of H H used H factor Ha- gly gly gly response in the H, the acid oxidation. regulated by and the metabolism is decreased.IF1 is is down for gly gly metabolism and glucosecolysis. is turn so, associated for the gly transportostasis.",0.41391427514785406,0.2777777777777778

How does Rif1 regulate DNA replication?,"Rif1 (Rap1-interacting-factor-1), originally identified as a telomere-binding factor in yeast, is a critical determinant of the replication timing programme in human cells. Rif1 tightly binds to nuclear-insoluble structures at late-M-to-early-G1 and regulates chromatin-loop sizes. Furthermore, Rif1 colocalizes specifically with the mid-S replication foci. Thus, Rif1 establishes the mid-S replication domains that are restrained from being activated at early-S-phase. Overall, Rif1 plays crucial roles in determining the replication timing domain structures in human cells through regulating higher-order chromatin architecture. This function of Rif1 depends on its interaction with PP1 phosphatases and the PP1/Rif1 interaction is downregulated by the phosphorylation of Rif1, most likely by CDK/DDK.","Rif1 regulatesRid)Racting RNAR)1) a a as a transcriptionomerre-binding protein, the, is a key regulatorant of DNA replication of of of yeast DNA.if1 is regulates to the DNAbindingensitiveuble DNA and the transcriptiontransoleDNA-m-M- and early theatin-binding replication at, Rif1 bindsatesizes to to the nuclear-G- domainoci,, Rif1 is a binding-S replication sequence of are required by the activated by early GG-G by, Rif1 is a roles in the the replication timing of of of yeast cells. its the-S DNAatin-. is is Rif1 is on the role with the- andoryase and the expression1 phosphPif1 phosph. mediatedregulated in the Ratlation of PPif1 phosph which notably due the11RK/",0.43213988395842473,0.2905982905982907

Describe RIblast,"LncRNAs play important roles in various biological processes. Although more than 58 000 human lncRNA genes have been discovered, most known lncRNAs are still poorly characterized. One approach to understanding the functions of lncRNAs is the detection of the interacting RNA target of each lncRNA. Because experimental detections of comprehensive lncRNA-RNA interactions are difficult, computational prediction of lncRNA-RNA interactions is an indispensable technique. However, the high computational costs of existing RNA-RNA interaction prediction tools prevent their application to large-scale lncRNA datasets. 'RIblast' is an ultrafast RNA-RNA interaction prediction method based on the seed-and-extension approach.

How does thyroid hormone regulate mitochondrial biogenesis in the myocardium?,"T4 increases myocardial mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity, oxygen consumption and markers of mitochondrial biogenesis. The marked, parallel increases in PPARalpha levels suggest its potential involvement in mediating myocardial-specific remodeling of mitochondria in response to T4.  T3 induces mitochondrial biogenesis. In fact, T3 treatment for 72h  increases activity of respiratory complexes II, IV, V and citrate synthase (CS), levels of mitochondrial enzyme subunits (e.g. COXI, COXIV) and nuclear-encoded transcription factors, involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (e.g. PGC-1, mtTFA and PPAR-alpha).  Furthermore, L-T3 increases  the expression of factors involved in mitochondrial DNA transcription and biogenesis, such as hypoxic inducible factor-1α, mitochondrial transcription factor A and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ coactivator-1α, in the LV peri-infarct zone.
The activation of TFAM and TFB2M expression is shown to be required for the induction of mtDNA biogenesis by T3. Truncated forms of the nuclear receptor TRα1, with molecular weights of 43 kDa (p43) and 28 Kda have been previously identified in mitochondria. P43 is a mitochondrial T3 receptor which stimulates mitochondrial transcription and protein synthesis in the presence of T3. p43 depletion in mice decreases mitochondrial DNA replication and respiratory chain activity.","Treatment regulates mitochondrialocardium mitochondrial biavailabilityg activity and andation, mitochondrial of mitochondrial biogenesis. thyroid increase elevated increase in myH activity activity are that role role in mitochondrialating mitochondrialocardial bim bieling. theria. the to the4.4 increases mitochondrial biogenesis in addition, T3 is is my%3 is mitochondrial of my and and and III, and, Vrate.ase IIVK and of T bi Hunits IIS.g., T2,, CXI, and mitochondrial-dependentoding nuclear factors ( which in mitochondrial biogenesis.e.g. TEG)1, PDNA2, mtARα1) T, T3T3 is mitochondrial mitochondrial mitochondrial of the such in mitochondrial bi remod, mitochondrialogenesis. including as theox transcriptionactivationible in (1 (, and- factor-, theicidome-ator- by A�--ator �1 (, and the my.oxheltransractction and.T thyroid of T1 in TFAM in in in in mediated to be associated for mitochondrial mitochondrial of mitochondrialT-ogenesis in T3-imation TF of TF thyroid- TX- ( which the localization of T,Da and2753k and 37 kDa ( been reported reported. theria.53 is a highly-3- that is mitochondrial bi and expression expression. the LV of T3.53. in the. mitochondrial mitochondrial methyl and mitochondrial activity migration.",0.4483728554914917,0.30769230769230765

Using an alignment-free information-retrieval approach, we have comprehensively identified all long identical multispecies elements (LIMEs), which include both syntenic and nonsyntenic regions, of at least 100 identical base pairs shared by at least two genomes. Using a comparative genomics approach with four dicotyledonous plant species (Arabidopsis thaliana, papaya [Carica papaya], poplar [Populus trichocarpa], and grape [Vitis vinifera]), we detected hundreds of CNSs upstream of Arabidopsis genes. We consequently compared the genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana and rice, which diverged about 200 million years ago, and identified 25 ultraconserved elements that are longer than 100 bp.

Prolamellar bodies (PLBs) efficiently capture the light energy for photo conversion in etioplasts. Upon illumination, the etioplasts transformed into regular chloroplasts.

"Which phenomenon is known as the ""calcium paradox"" in the isolated perfused heart?","When hearts are reperfused with Ca++ after a short period of Ca++-free perfusion, irreversible loss of electrical and mechanical activity is observed. This phenomenon, first described by Zimmerman and Hulsmann, was termed the ""calcium paradox"". This phenomenon is concomitant with a rapid consumption of myocardial high-energy phosphate stores. The Ca(2+) paradox represents a good model to study Ca(2+) overload injury in ischemic heart diseases. The Ca(2+) paradox can be elicited by perfusing isolated hearts with Ca(2+)-free media for 3 min or 5 min followed by 30 min of Ca(2+) repletion. A possible mechanism for the 'calcium paradox' is that exposure to a calcium-free medium removes extracellular calcium rendering the sarcolemma more permeable to calcium. On calcium repletion, cell injury is triggered by calcium influx. Cardiac dysfunction due to Ca2+ -paradox may be associated with apoptosis.","The the are perffused, calcium(, the Ca period of time++,binding perfusion, the Ca of Ca activity/ activity is observed.

Are there transposon-free regions in mammalian genomes?,"Yes. Despite the presence of over 3 million transposons separated on average by approximately 500 bp, the human and mouse genomes each contain almost 1000 transposon-free regions (TFRs) over 10 kb in length. The majority of human TFRs correlate with orthologous TFRs in the mouse, despite the fact that most transposons are lineage specific. Many human TFRs also overlap with orthologous TFRs in the marsupial opossum, indicating that these regions have remained refractory to transposon insertion for long evolutionary periods. Over 90% of the bases covered by TFRs are noncoding, much of which is not highly conserved. Most TFRs are not associated with unusual nucleotide composition, but are significantly associated with genes encoding developmental regulators, suggesting that they represent extended regions of regulatory information that are largely unable to tolerate insertions, a conclusion difficult to reconcile with current conceptions of gene regulation.","Yes, Trans the absence of trans 100, transposon, by the, a 1 kbp, there presence genome mouse genomes are contain approximately 1 transposons-free regions.ps) the kb. length. trans of these genomesCRs are with transologs transFRs, the genome genome whereas the absence that the ofposons are trans-. of TFRs are have with theologs TFRs in the mammalianupial genomeusum. which that trans regions are a inractory in theposons-. a periods periods. the% of mammalian mammalian of by transFRs are trans-oding regions and less which are trans trans conserved. ofFRs are trans trans with trans Totide sequences, but with associated conserv with the that T delay. such that T are a regions of the regions. are not conserv to be transions. such feature that to prove with the T of the expression.",0.44857960864532176,0.32

Once this occurs, it is final and fixed for that cell and all its descendants (1,2).  Barr body is an inactivated X chromosome in the normal female somatic cell. Inactivation of these chromosomes is known as Lyonization. Lyonization has both genetic and clinical significance. Barr body can be easily identified with ordinary stains. It also helps in identifying the sex of an individual when used judiciously.

What is known about PAI-1 in longevity in humans?,"Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) has been shown to be a key component of the senescence-related secretome and a direct mediator of cellular senescence. In murine models of accelerated aging, genetic deficiency and targeted inhibition of PAI-1 protect against aging-like pathology and prolong life span. However, the role of PAI-1 in human longevity remains unclear.
, in centenarians there was a significantly higher frequency of the 4G allele and of the homozygous 4G4G genotype associated with high PAI-1 levels. Since high PAI-1 is considered a predictor of recurrent myocardial infarction in young men, it is intriguing that the corresponding genetic marker is more frequent in centenarians who have escaped major age-related atherothrombotic disease and reached the extreme limits of human life.

List available biomedical question answering systems.,"We live in an age of access to more information than ever before. The exponential growth in the volume of publications in the biomedical domain has made it impossible for an individual to keep pace with the advances. Thus, there is a need for intelligent information retrieval systems that can summarize relevant and reliable textual sources to satisfy a user's query. Question answering is a specialized type of information retrieval with the aim of returning precise short answers to queries posed as natural language questions. This accentuates the need for fast and accurate biomedical question answering systems. In this paper we introduce INDOC -- a biomedical question answering system based on novel ideas of indexing and extracting the answer to the questions posed. Increased access to information allows for more informed and empowered researchers, while information overload becomes an increasingly serious risk. INDOC displays the results in clusters to help the user arrive the most relevant set of documents quickly. Evaluation was done against the standard OHSUMED test collection.

What are the exonic splice enhancers?,"In mammals there is a bias in amino acid usage near splice sites that is explained, in large part, by the high density of exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) in these regions. Exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) activate pre-mRNA splicing by promoting the use of the flanking splice sites. Some of these variants may have an effect on pre-mRNA splicing, either by altering degenerate positions of splice site sequences or by affecting intronic or exonic splicing regulatory sequences such as exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs). For inherited disease, the main mechanism responsible for the splicing defect is splice site loss, whereas for cancer the predominant mechanism of splicing disruption is predicted to be exon skipping via loss of exonic splicing enhancers or gain of exonic splicing silencer elements. FELINES was shown to be useful for characterizing branchsites, polypyrimidine tracts and 5' and 3' splice sites in the intron databases and exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) in S.pombe exons. Unexpectedly, a fully experimental dataset identifies motifs that commonly behave opposite to the consensus, for example, being enriched in exon cores where splice-associated mutations are rare.Prior analyses that used the RESCUE-ESE set of hexamers captured the properties of consensus exonic splice enhancers.","Ex the, are a large between the acid spl towards theice enh, is associated by in part part, by the presence affinity of theonic splice.ancers.exPs) in the regions.onic splice enhancers areESEs) are the-transRNA andicing and the the formation of the exanking splice motif. ex these ex are be a effect on the-mRNA splicing, such by the theation spl or theice sites sites or by activating theram spl intronic splice. regions. as theonic splice.ancers.ESEs) example ex, ex ex ex of for ex exicing of is theicing- activation. which the the, ex mechanism is splice is is the to be theonic-. the of theon splice.ancers. by of exon splice enhencing..issions is are found to be involved for theizing the- and andmersasesidine spl, the- spl 6' splice enh. the cellronic of. inon splice enhancers.ESPs) are theARS eleg.ori.on..ly, the large ex ex of exs in are occur in to the ex spl such example, the associated in theonic skipping and theice enhbinding ex are expressed, to of have ex exEs1 methodbased method of exacethyl showed a presence of ex splonic splice enhancers.",0.41975158389081973,0.2697201017811705

The Tsix gene, antisense of Xist, through transcription negatively regulates Xist and protects one X-chromosome in cis from inactivation by Xist. Although, the precise molecular mechanism is still unclear it has been shown that Tsix transcription regulates the chromatin structure by altering histone tail modifications and DNA methylation at the Xist promoter. In addition, Xist and Tsix RNAs form duplexes in vivo and are processed to small RNAs, which have a potential regulatory function.","The of the most genes chromosome involvedactivation cells cells, the to inactivation byT chromosome) by by the T chromosomein.CI is by a transcription regulator polymer that is the genesatin- to the of the genes genes chromosomes. theactivation.

What is GeneCodeq?,The exponential reduction in cost of genome sequencing has resulted in a rapid growth of genomic data. Most of the entropy of short read data lies not in the sequence of read bases themselves but in their Quality Scores-the confidence measurement that each base has been sequenced correctly. Lossless compression methods are now close to their theoretical limits and hence there is a need for lossy methods that further reduce the complexity of these data without impacting downstream analyses.

Describe Click-PEGylation,"One approach that can facilitate a targeted assessment of candidate proteins, as well as proteins that are low in abundance or proteomically challenging, is by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Redox-modified cysteine residues are selectively tagged with a large group, such as a polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer, and then the proteins are separated by electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting, which allows the inference of redox changes based on band shifts. However, the applicability of this method has been impaired by the difficulty of cleanly modifying protein thiols by large PEG reagents. To establish a more robust method for redox-selective PEGylation a Click chemistry approach has been developed where free thiol groups are first labelled with a reagent modified to contain an alkyne moiety, which is subsequently Click-reacted with a PEG molecule containing a complementary azide function. This strategy can be adapted to study reversibly reduced or oxidised cysteines. Separation of the thiol labelling step from the PEG conjugation greatly facilitates the fidelity and flexibility of this approach.","Click of to is be the more and of the genes is is well as their that are involved- the, areolyole enriched to is the usingrophysic methods..ays.ucing-P proteinstopine- are used rearr to the specific number of which as the singlepeene glycol (PEG) orase a a a methyl are rearr by arophoretis. by aodlotting. and is for analysis of theox-. on theed., the resultsability of this approach to been limited by the presence of identifyingly labeling the-roms, the-EGsagents. address the more efficient approach for theox-inducedive chromEGylation, new- is is been developed that the-iols are identified identified with a single-, to the a additionalkylated-iety. and is then added-Pferred to a newEG-. a new methylole-. approach is be used to other theibility altered chrom modifiedized chromsteine,arate of the twoiolselling and and the pEGylugation step improves the identification of stability of the approach.",0.3854513486033112,0.2586750788643533

what is the role of IGF-1 in cardiac regeneration after myocardial infarction?,"Ischemia-reperfusion injury is a strong stimulus for both global and focal cardiomyocyte progenitor cell marker up-regulations, correlating to the endogenous up-regulation of IGF-1. Furthermore, in an animal model of myocardial infarction, intracoronary administration of IGF-1 is shown to reduce pathological cardiac remodeling, induce myocardial regeneration, and improve ventricular function. IGF-1 is a potent modulator of stem cell replication, commitment to the myocyte lineage, and myocyte differentiation. In another study, the dual delivery of IGF-1 and HGF from affinity-binding alginate biomaterial prevented cell apoptosis, induced cardiomyocyte cell cycle re-entry and increased the incidence of GATA-4-positive cell clusters. The addition of nanofiber-mediated IGF-1 delivery to Cardiac Progenitor Cells therapy improved in part the recovery of myocardial structure and function after infarction. IGF-1 promotes proliferation and survival of CPCs.

How do histone methyltransferases cause histone modification?,"Histone methyltransferases (HMTs) are responsible for the site-specific addition of covalent modifications on the histone tails, which serve as markers for the recruitment of chromatin organization complexes. There are two major types of HMTs: histone-lysine N-Methyltransferases and histone-arginine N-methyltransferases. The former methylate specific lysine (K) residues such as 4, 9, 27, 36, and 79 on histone H3 and residue 20 on histone H4. The latter methylate arginine (R) residues such as 2, 8, 17, and 26 on histone H3 and residue 3 on histone H4. Depending on what residue is modified and the degree of methylation (mono-, di- and tri-methylation), lysine methylation of histones is linked to either transcriptionally active or silent chromatin.",How do histone methyltransferases cause histone modification? ,3.7241978670585916e-08,0.047619047619047616

Is DNA methylation correlated with nucleosome occupancy?,"DNA methylation can determine nucleosome positioning. Using a novel bioinformatics pipeline, we show a striking anti-correlation between nucleosome occupancy and DNA methylation at CTCF regions that is not present at promoters. DNA methylation determines nucleosome occupancy in the 5'-CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes. In contrast, exons demonstrate a high degree of methylation and nucleosome occupancy. Although global DNA demethylation has been observed after treatment, it is unclear to what extent demethylation induces changes in nucleosome occupancy, a key determinant of gene expression. In order to systematically evaluate potential diversities among CGIs and ultimately to illuminate the link between diversity of CGIs and their epigenetic variation, we analyzed the nucleotide-resolution DNA methylation maps  of multiple cellular origins. Using this global approach, we observe the dependency of nucleosome occupancy upon the DNA methylation status. Exonic DNA methylation seems to function together with exonic nucleosomes and H3K36me3 for the proper splicing of transcripts with different expression levels. Transcription, histone modifications, and DNA methylation alter this ""ground state"" by having distinct effects on both nucleosome positioning and occupancy.

What is the mechanism of microRNA deregulation in carcinogenesis?,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous non-protein coding single-stranded RNAs (19–25 nucleotides in length) generated from  cleavage of larger non-coding RNAs by the ribonuclease III enzyme Dicer.

Approximately one-third of the protein-coding genes are susceptible to miRNA regulation. Accumulating evidence indicates that deregulated miRNA expression is associated with the onset and progression of a number of human cancers. Therefore, cancer-associated miRNAs (CA-miRNAs) could regulate target genes by acting either as ""oncogenes"" or ""tumor suppressor miRNA (TS-miRNAs)"". In line with this, numerous cancers (e.g. breast, lung, oesophageal, prostate, pancreatic, gastric and colon cancer) have been classified based on their unique miRNA expression profile.",What is the mechanism of microRNA deregulation in carcinogenesis? ,1.107167463416321e-07,0.051948051948051945

Which proteins act as factors that promote transcription-coupled repair in bacteria?,"Transcription coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER or TCR) is a cellular process by which UV-induced damage and other road-blocks encountered in the transcribed strand are restored. Bacterial transcription-coupled repair is initiated when RNA polymerase stalled at a DNA lesion is removed by Mfd (Mutation frequency decline), an ATP-dependent DNA translocase. Mfd is the major transcription repair coupling factor in bacteria. Also, the transcription elongation factor NusA, in addition to its role in recruiting translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases to gaps encountered during transcription,  promotes an alternative class of TCR involved in the identification and removal of a class of lesion, such as the N(2)-f-dG lesion.",Which proteins act as factors that promote transcription-coupled repair in bacteria? ,3.684457860828459e-05,0.096

How does Ssu72 mediate gene looping?,"Investigation of chromosome folding in mutants confirms roles for RSC, ""gene looping"" factor Ssu72, Mediator, H3K56 acetyltransferase Rtt109, and the N-terminal tail of H4 in folding of the yeast genome. The essential N terminus of the Pta1 scaffold protein is required for snoRNA transcription termination and Ssu72 function but is dispensable for pre-mRNA 3'-end processing. TFIIB crosslinks to both the promoter and terminator regions of the PMA1 and BLM10 genes, and its association with the terminator, but not the promoter, is adversely affected by E62K and by depletion of the Ssu72 component of the CPF 3' end processing complex, and is independent of TBP. We propose a model for RNAP II transcription in which promoter and terminator regions are juxtaposed, and that the resulting gene loops facilitate transcription reinitiation by the same molecule of RNAP II in a manner dependent upon Ssu72-mediated CTD dephosphorylation. The first 300 amino acids of Pta1 are sufficient for interactions with Ssu72, which is needed for pre-mRNA cleavage.

The target genes are most often transcription factors involved in embryonic development and differentiation. GRBs often contain extensive gene deserts, as well as additional 'bystander' genes intertwined with HCNEs but whose expression and function are unrelated to those of the target gene. GRB target genes have properties that set them apart from their bystanders as well as other genes in the genome: longer CpG islands, a higher number and wider spacing of alternative transcription start sites, and a distinct composition of transcription factor binding sites in their core/proximal promoters.

How does Rif1 regulate DNA replication?,"Rif1 (Rap1-interacting-factor-1), originally identified as a telomere-binding factor in yeast, is a critical determinant of the replication timing programme in human cells. Rif1 tightly binds to nuclear-insoluble structures at late-M-to-early-G1 and regulates chromatin-loop sizes. Furthermore, Rif1 colocalizes specifically with the mid-S replication foci. Thus, Rif1 establishes the mid-S replication domains that are restrained from being activated at early-S-phase. Overall, Rif1 plays crucial roles in determining the replication timing domain structures in human cells through regulating higher-order chromatin architecture. This function of Rif1 depends on its interaction with PP1 phosphatases and the PP1/Rif1 interaction is downregulated by the phosphorylation of Rif1, most likely by CDK/DDK.",How does Rif1 regulate DNA replication? ,3.709046807158347e-08,0.031496062992125984

Describe RIblast,"LncRNAs play important roles in various biological processes. Although more than 58 000 human lncRNA genes have been discovered, most known lncRNAs are still poorly characterized. One approach to understanding the functions of lncRNAs is the detection of the interacting RNA target of each lncRNA. Because experimental detections of comprehensive lncRNA-RNA interactions are difficult, computational prediction of lncRNA-RNA interactions is an indispensable technique. However, the high computational costs of existing RNA-RNA interaction prediction tools prevent their application to large-scale lncRNA datasets. 'RIblast' is an ultrafast RNA-RNA interaction prediction method based on the seed-and-extension approach.

How does thyroid hormone regulate mitochondrial biogenesis in the myocardium?,"T4 increases myocardial mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity, oxygen consumption and markers of mitochondrial biogenesis. The marked, parallel increases in PPARalpha levels suggest its potential involvement in mediating myocardial-specific remodeling of mitochondria in response to T4.  T3 induces mitochondrial biogenesis. In fact, T3 treatment for 72h  increases activity of respiratory complexes II, IV, V and citrate synthase (CS), levels of mitochondrial enzyme subunits (e.g. COXI, COXIV) and nuclear-encoded transcription factors, involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (e.g. PGC-1, mtTFA and PPAR-alpha).  Furthermore, L-T3 increases  the expression of factors involved in mitochondrial DNA transcription and biogenesis, such as hypoxic inducible factor-1α, mitochondrial transcription factor A and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ coactivator-1α, in the LV peri-infarct zone.
The activation of TFAM and TFB2M expression is shown to be required for the induction of mtDNA biogenesis by T3. Truncated forms of the nuclear receptor TRα1, with molecular weights of 43 kDa (p43) and 28 Kda have been previously identified in mitochondria.

"Which phenomenon is known as the ""calcium paradox"" in the isolated perfused heart?","When hearts are reperfused with Ca++ after a short period of Ca++-free perfusion, irreversible loss of electrical and mechanical activity is observed. This phenomenon, first described by Zimmerman and Hulsmann, was termed the ""calcium paradox"". This phenomenon is concomitant with a rapid consumption of myocardial high-energy phosphate stores. The Ca(2+) paradox represents a good model to study Ca(2+) overload injury in ischemic heart diseases. The Ca(2+) paradox can be elicited by perfusing isolated hearts with Ca(2+)-free media for 3 min or 5 min followed by 30 min of Ca(2+) repletion. A possible mechanism for the 'calcium paradox' is that exposure to a calcium-free medium removes extracellular calcium rendering the sarcolemma more permeable to calcium. On calcium repletion, cell injury is triggered by calcium influx. Cardiac dysfunction due to Ca2+ -paradox may be associated with apoptosis.","Which phenomenon is known as the ""calcium paradox"" in the isolated perfused heart?

The majority of human TFRs correlate with orthologous TFRs in the mouse, despite the fact that most transposons are lineage specific. Many human TFRs also overlap with orthologous TFRs in the marsupial opossum, indicating that these regions have remained refractory to transposon insertion for long evolutionary periods. Over 90% of the bases covered by TFRs are noncoding, much of which is not highly conserved. Most TFRs are not associated with unusual nucleotide composition, but are significantly associated with genes encoding developmental regulators, suggesting that they represent extended regions of regulatory information that are largely unable to tolerate insertions, a conclusion difficult to reconcile with current conceptions of gene regulation.",Are there transposon-free regions in mammalian genomes? ,3.5970665151626917e-09,0.05298013245033112

Is there any role of interleukin-11 in cardiovascular fibrosis?,"Yes. Interleukin 11 (IL11) upregulation is the dominant transcriptional response to TGFB1 exposure and required for its profibrotic effect. IL11 and its receptor (IL11RA) are expressed specifically in fibroblasts where they drive non-canonical, ERK-dependent autocrine signalling that is required for fibrogenic protein synthesis. In mice, fibroblast-specific Il11 transgene expression or Il11 injection causes heart and kidney fibrosis and organ failure whereas genetic deletion of Il11ra1 is protective against disease. Thus, inhibition of IL11 prevents fibroblast activation across organs and species in response to a range of important pro-fibrotic stimuli.",Is there any role of interleukin-11 in cardiovascular fibrosis? ,3.349974254703443e-05,0.07766990291262137

However, the role of PAI-1 in human longevity remains unclear.
, in centenarians there was a significantly higher frequency of the 4G allele and of the homozygous 4G4G genotype associated with high PAI-1 levels. Since high PAI-1 is considered a predictor of recurrent myocardial infarction in young men, it is intriguing that the corresponding genetic marker is more frequent in centenarians who have escaped major age-related atherothrombotic disease and reached the extreme limits of human life.

List available biomedical question answering systems.,"We live in an age of access to more information than ever before. The exponential growth in the volume of publications in the biomedical domain has made it impossible for an individual to keep pace with the advances. Thus, there is a need for intelligent information retrieval systems that can summarize relevant and reliable textual sources to satisfy a user's query. Question answering is a specialized type of information retrieval with the aim of returning precise short answers to queries posed as natural language questions. This accentuates the need for fast and accurate biomedical question answering systems. In this paper we introduce INDOC -- a biomedical question answering system based on novel ideas of indexing and extracting the answer to the questions posed. Increased access to information allows for more informed and empowered researchers, while information overload becomes an increasingly serious risk. INDOC displays the results in clusters to help the user arrive the most relevant set of documents quickly. Evaluation was done against the standard OHSUMED test collection.

What are the exonic splice enhancers?,"In mammals there is a bias in amino acid usage near splice sites that is explained, in large part, by the high density of exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) in these regions. Exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) activate pre-mRNA splicing by promoting the use of the flanking splice sites. Some of these variants may have an effect on pre-mRNA splicing, either by altering degenerate positions of splice site sequences or by affecting intronic or exonic splicing regulatory sequences such as exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs). For inherited disease, the main mechanism responsible for the splicing defect is splice site loss, whereas for cancer the predominant mechanism of splicing disruption is predicted to be exon skipping via loss of exonic splicing enhancers or gain of exonic splicing silencer elements. FELINES was shown to be useful for characterizing branchsites, polypyrimidine tracts and 5' and 3' splice sites in the intron databases and exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) in S.pombe exons.

Describe Click-PEGylation,"One approach that can facilitate a targeted assessment of candidate proteins, as well as proteins that are low in abundance or proteomically challenging, is by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Redox-modified cysteine residues are selectively tagged with a large group, such as a polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer, and then the proteins are separated by electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting, which allows the inference of redox changes based on band shifts. However, the applicability of this method has been impaired by the difficulty of cleanly modifying protein thiols by large PEG reagents. To establish a more robust method for redox-selective PEGylation a Click chemistry approach has been developed where free thiol groups are first labelled with a reagent modified to contain an alkyne moiety, which is subsequently Click-reacted with a PEG molecule containing a complementary azide function. This strategy can be adapted to study reversibly reduced or oxidised cysteines. Separation of the thiol labelling step from the PEG conjugation greatly facilitates the fidelity and flexibility of this approach.",Describe Click-PEGylation ,0.0,0.011695906432748539

What laboratory abnormalities are commonly seen in patients with COVID-19?,"Common laboratory abnormalities among patients with COVID-19 include:

1. Elevated inflammatory markers (e.g., ferritin, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate).
2. Elevated aminotransaminase levels (i.e., AST, ALT).
3. Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels.
4. Lymphopenia, leucocytosis.

Abnormalities in coagulation testing (e.g., increased D-Dimers, decreased platelets), elevated procalcitonin levels, and elevated troponin levels have also been reported. The degree of these abnormalities tends to correlate with disease severity.",What laboratory abnormalities are commonly seen in patients with COVID-19? ,0.00024035140191306487,0.14285714285714285

What is magnetoreception?,"Magnetoreception is an enigmatic, poorly understood sensory ability, described mainly on the basis of behavioural studies in animals of diverse taxa. The ability to perceive geomagnetic fields (GMFs) represents a fascinating biological phenomenon. Studies on transgenic flies have provided evidence that photosensitive Cryptochromes (Cry) are involved in the response to magnetic fields (MFs). The photoreceptor protein cryptochrome is thought to host, upon light absorption, a radical pair that is sensitive to very weak magnetic fields, endowing migratory birds with a magnetic compass sense.",What is magnetoreception? ,1.5560361557269457e-11,0.023255813953488372
